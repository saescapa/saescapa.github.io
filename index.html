    <h1> Samuel Escapa Otani @ San Francisco, CA </h1>
    <p>
      Hello! Not much to see here, I haven't updated my website in 4+ years. But, I will rebuild <s>once I get enough time</s> whenever I feel like it.
    <details>
      <summary>More About me</summary>
      <p>I am originally from Barcelona, Spain, where I grew up and started to learn to code when I was around 10 years
        old. I moved to the US with my family in 2014. In high school, I attended and organized over 30 hackathons, and in the summers
        interning at various companies in Madrid. In 2017, I started college at the University of San Francisco,
        where I also was working part-time at TensorIoT as their first employee and engineering hire.
        
        While finishing college, I moved to Zendesk where I joined as an intern, reaching senior engineer in 2 years. I worked primarily on frontend development,
        mentoring junior engineers and interns.
        
        I eventually moved to now Slingshot, where I have been for over 3 years, taking a product to market from the ground up.</p>
      <p>On the side, I volunteer at Hack+ where I mentor students and give them a sneak peak of the professional world. I also direct light shows for small venues and events for fun.</p>
