    <p>
      Hello! Not much to see here, I haven't updated my website in 4+ years. But, I will rebuild once I get enough time!
    <details>
      <summary>More About me</summary>
      <p>I am originally from Barcelona, Spain, where I grew up and started to learn to code when I was around 10 years
        old. I moved to the US with my family in 2014, at my freshman year of high school. In high school, I attended
        and organized over 30 hackathons, while interning at various companies in Madrid during the summers. In 2017, I
        started college at the University of San Francisco, where I also was working part-time at TensorIoT, and then
        Zendesk.</p>
      <p>Now, my expertise has been on Web Development. On the side, I volunteer at Hack+ where I mentor students and
        give them a sneak peak of the professional world.</p>
